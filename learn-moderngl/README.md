# Learn ModernGL

While I do like the simplicity and easy-of-use from Raylib, if I want to truly learn about OpenGL and rending, I need to use a lower-level library with more control. ModernGL allows me to do this
in Python, without having to setup C/C++ libraries. 

I'm a Raylib fanboy, but I won't learn much about OpenGL as a whole with just RL. RL is great for getting things running, but I want to learn about OpenGL on a deeper level.
